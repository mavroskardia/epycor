Epycor
===================
Epycor is an Epicor client for use by my company.  It provides a caching, streamlined interface for time entry.

The Epicor interface is written in Python and the client application is written using Polymer (HTML, CSS, and ES6 JavaScript) on top of the Chrome Embedded Framework.
